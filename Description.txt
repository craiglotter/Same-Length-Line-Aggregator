Same Length Line Aggregator

Same Length Aggregator simply parses an input file, matching each text line's length against the user specified required length, using the inputted operator provided. If the result is true then that line is written to the new text file. 

Three operators are provided for, namely '=', '>', and '<'.

For example, with a length of 4 and the '=' operator selected:
aaa
bbbb
cccccc
dddd

will yield:
bbbb
dddd
